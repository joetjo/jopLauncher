# jopLauncher

Detect running game and record running time ( game has to be installed in a path that contains "jeux" , game process name will be used by default )

Other feature:
- show last 10 gaming sessions
- allow to exclude process
- allow to map a custom name for an exe or to use the parent folder name instead of the executable name.

# Bug To be fix
- setup a mapping keep old session in list ( bug ) and don't rename existing name in storage ( so 2 games exist )
- larger window
- use a grid to put session history info ( alignment is bad currenlty )

# Enhancement To be done
- remove exe extension from game name
- update last played on stating game ( with current total duration )
- better window placement at startup
- add launcher button + a way to select a different launcher that running executation + a way to disable the running mode if not supported.
