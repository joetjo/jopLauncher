Global game management platform that do not need internet, do not need any registering, do no store data into the cloud,
do not need access to your game account.... and discover automatically which game is running ( with a light and
configurable prerequisite on where to install game ).

> All the recorded data are local and nothing is published. Local data are not protected ( protection rely on your local account on your laptop/desktop )

- Detects running game and record running time ( game has to be installed in a path that contains "jeux" , game process
  name will be used by default )
- Detect common game platform and display which one is running
- shows last 10 gaming sessions and allows starting a new session of the corresponding game
- | -> or to search an already played game and allow to restart it
- | -> and applying a filter to see on installed game
- allows excluding process that are detected but are not game ( launcher, crash handler, etc.. you may discover strange
  things ).
- allows to map a custom name for an executable or to use the parent folder name instead of the executable name.
- allows customization on how to start a game ( launcher, alternative command line, parameters )
- allows linking on HTML page and a local document about each game

**Platform :** Windows ( python )
Note: the project is fully compatible to other platforms but tested only on Windows 10 and packaged only for Windows.

**Suggested Companion app**

A good companion app to take notes about your games : https://www.electronjs.org/apps/notable
it allows to set a markdown file by game and "tag" game to search in your own game. jopLauncher allows to link the md file of the game and to open it outside notable. What is interessant with notable is that is used standard markdown file that can used anywhere nut notable allows a nice tagging / indexing / searching / visualization.

# FAQ - Documentation

No manual available - here is the answer of the most common question

> My game use a generic launcher name use for many games, how automatic detection will deal with it ?

On first game that use the generic name, select it in history ( or search result ) and set a custom mapping using 'map' button' and set mapping to `PARENT`. Folder name will be used instead of executable name.

> My game executable name use ( automatic name ) is not really a good one, can I change it ?

Select game in history ( or search result ) and set a custom mapping using 'map'. Set the name you want instead of the original executable name.

> Jop Game Launcher has detect a process that is not a game, how to remove it ?

Select invalid game in history ( or search result ) and use `exclude` button. This executable will be removed and ignore if detected again. 
There is currently no way to cancel the executable exclusion using the application ( storage in json format has to be edited manually ).

Select game in history  and use `remove` button. Game will appears back when launch.
